# NeuralNetwork_FDK_Project
This study developed and tested an open-access, easy-to-use, and effective method for phenotyping FDK using a neural network capable of analyzing cell phone camera images. 

# FHB_heritability_script.R
Calulates REML-estimated variance components to estimate broad and narrow sense heritability of FDKL, FDKLhat, and DON in training (2019-20 preliminary and advanced scab trials) and test sets (2021-2022 preliminary trials ).
